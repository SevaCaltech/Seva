# TODO

### Important
- Finish Test Button functionality
    - connect Lambda function to RasPi
- Finish Take Picture function in the Repair guides
    - add a column to the SQLite db which step(s) the picture button should pop up on
- Populate all of the repair guides
- Push Notifications
- Don't need to add alive signals to SevaToilets Dynamo table
    - This happens because the current lambda will add any IoT message on the toilet topic to the table.
